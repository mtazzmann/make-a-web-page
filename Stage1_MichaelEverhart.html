       	 <b>The basics of the Web:</b> 
       	 	<br>
	       	 	<h2>HTML</h2> - Hypertext Markup Language commonly referred to, as HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets like &lt;html&gt;. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &lt;img&gt;. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
          <br>
       	 	<br>
	       	 	<h2>URLs</h2> - Uniform Resource Locator is a reference to a resource that specifies the location of the resource on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of uniform resource identifier although many people use the two terms interchangeably.  A URL implies the means to access an indicated resource, which is not true of every URL.  URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.
          <br>  
       	 	<br>
	       	 	<h2>HTTP</h2> - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.  HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web Hypertext is structured text that uses logical links (hyperlinks) between nodes containing text. HTTP is the protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.

            <h2><b>Tree Like Structures</b></h2> - is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a "tree structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree, even though the chart is generally upside down compared to an actual tree, with the "root" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.

            <br>
          <div>  
            <h2><b>HTML and CSS are both Languages</b></h2> - Language of HTML is Tag
            HTML controls the "structure" of a web page
            CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks)

             <h2><b>Text Editors (for programming):</b></h2> - When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.

           <div>
          	 <h2><b>Trouble Shooting:</b></h2> 
              1. Collect evidence (what makes this program fail?). <br>
              2. Generate theories (what may have caused this problem?).<br>
              3. Test those theories (if my theory is correct, how could I find out?).<br>
              4. Fix the problem.

While most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.

            <h2><b>Inheritance</b> </h2> - Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants.  It relies on the document tree.
          
         </div>  
         <br>   
          <div>
            <h2><b>Properties that can be inherited</b></h2>  - Are color, font, letter spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white space and word spacing.
